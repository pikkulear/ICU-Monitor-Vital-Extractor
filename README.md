# ICU-Monitor-Vital-Extractor
This project focuses on extracting Vitals information, like heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressures, from an image of an ICU monitor. The model uses logic based mapping of vitals thus making it robust to monitor-type changes. Also, the detection model is based on YOLOv7 which supports real-time detection, thus it can be used with surveillance cameras.
